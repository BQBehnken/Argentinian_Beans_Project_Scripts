These are the scripts and data for our preprint on Argentinian beans. 
In accordance with both my values for transparency and the requirements of the journal, I'm submitting all my data and scripts for analysis onto this repository. 

No project is perfect, and thus I treat this as a stepping stone and learning experience for better science down the road. Feel free to reach out with comments and corrections if you feel so inclined. 

This paper is the product of several people; namely, W George and A Chaparro. I took on this project after their departure and drove it to completion with final assays and analyses. 
The research and data generated are the work of all of us together, including as all AK Schmidt. Original pilot data was obtained by AD Steinbrenner a number of years ago. 

As such, the data and code presented here are not solely mine, but our collaborative effort to identify what is going on with these puzzling beans from Jujuy. 
Much of the code from Figure 1A and B is by ADS, but I optimized it. 
Much of the code from Figure 2B and C is by WG, and I only cleaned it up. 

The rest of the code from Figure 3 as well as from the supplementals is my work with debugging and package recommendations from various GPTs. 

The story behind this paper is told through the three main figures and can be summarized as such: 
INR is a protein that mediates legume defenses against herbivory. 
The incidental discovery of low expression INR beans from Argentina is due to a shared genetic basis. (Fig 1)
Key phenotypic assays of ethylene, expression, and marker gene expression suggested they would also be susceptible to herbivores. (Figs 2 & 3)
Contrary to our hypothesis, herbivores fared comparatively well on these low expression plants to WT. (Fig 3)
Thus, low INR expression does not translate to herbivore susceptibility. 

Additionally, one key philosophical lesson in all of this is that we get what we screen for. Low expression is just that - low expression. 
But it is perfectly valid to predict that the presence of a "watchman" molecule at all in the system will still activate downstream defenses. Maybe not as much, but it's not zero. 

For a good comparison, check out our tritrophic interactions paper. 

Each script that I provide has its own internal annotation and commentary on why we did what we did, who generated which dataset, as well as any other choices we made in presenting the data.
